                        <p>Hey there! I’m Mary Anne B. Gencianos, a First Year college Student in Holy Cross of Davao College and Currently taking a program of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology .I am an adventurer at heart, passionate about Sports. My journey in life has led me to pursue this Program since I am naturally ineterested in technology so I decided to take this path. I also love exploring new challenges along the way.</p>
                           <p> When I'm not working on projects,or doing things I like, you can probably find me  getting lost in a new book, writing a new poem, or binge-watching true crime documentaries,horror etc(movies). I’m always up for a good conversation and enjoy connecting with people who are as curious about the world as I am.</p>
                           
                            <p>In short, I’m , a movie goer, a lifelong learner who is always curios and want to try new things, with an appreciation for  art, technology,and nature, etc.</p>
